First horns: should look more like this https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dota2_gamepedia/images/c/ce/Cosmetic_icon_Emerald_Subjugation.png/revision/latest?cb=20211226115129
but with one side broken and caped with jewelry and smaller mini horn in the middle
ears: are only present in dragonborn form, big and have fluffy fur in the inner ear, 
not sure the mane would work, maybe need to twitch to fluff in the back of the head to the base of the tail and on the back of joints.
paws: more pronounced digits
